# qfh_antenna_mold_OpenSCAD

[OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) parametric model of a [QFH antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helical_antenna) mold.

See "phyical settings" and "practical settings" banners for knobs to tweak. The dimensions are calculated using the same logic as [John Coppens' QFH antenna dimension calculator](http://jcoppens.com/ant/qfh/calc.en.php)
