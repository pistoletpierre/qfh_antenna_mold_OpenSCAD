# qfh_antenna_mold_OpenSCAD

[OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org/) parametric model of a [QFH antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helical_antenna) mold.

Currently dimensions are hard-coded for [L1 GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_signals) with the help of [John Coppens' dimension calculator](http://jcoppens.com/ant/qfh/calc.en.php)

Goal is to be able to plug those calculator inputs in to the OpenSCAD script & get a perfectly-sized 3D-printable mold around which to wrap your wire & connect it to your coax.
